👋 Hi, I'm **Towhidul Islam**

I work in Machine Learning and I like using data to explain how things actually work. I come from a Management Information Systems background, along with Computer Science training, so I approach problems with both a business mindset and a technical lens.

A lot of my learning comes from building. I'm working on projects that involve data cleaning, feature exploration, predictive modeling, dashboards, and research-driven analysis. I enjoy taking a messy dataset, asking a clear question, and using Python or SQL to find an answer that feels useful.

**What I work with:**
Python (data processing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis)
Machine Learning (regression, classification, model evaluation)
Statistics (hypothesis testing, probability, sampling)
SQL
Tableau and Power BI
Business and marketing analytics

I'm still growing and adding more work to my portfolio. I care about steady progress and letting the results show over time.
